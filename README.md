# 🖥️ Terminal Portfolio — v1.6

> An interactive, command-line-style personal portfolio for [Kirati Rattanaporn (Win)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft:Kirati_Rattanaporn).  
> Inspired by the elegant CLI aesthetic of [corsetti.dev](https://www.corsetti.dev) — reimagined with more interactivity, personality, and secrets.

## 📦 About This Project

This is a full-screen **React + Tailwind CSS** web app designed to look and feel like a terminal interface.  
It’s not just for show — it’s interactive. Users can type commands, discover Easter eggs, explore my achievements, and even "break" the system.  

This project is both a personal creative expression and a tech showcase.

## 🤓 Inspiration

This project was deeply inspired by [corsetti.dev](https://www.corsetti.dev) — a beautiful example of how portfolios can be fun, interactive, and different.
I took the idea and added more **hidden features, animated typing effects**, and even **fake terminal file systems**.
